This is a sample messenger app generated by Amazon Web Services using their resources.

This code is completely untested; I'd appreciate some help in this because I haven't learned how to and it would probably be best if 
multiple people tested it and reported their experience. This'll help us learn if resources are properly allocated.

There's a chance that I fucked up the upload but the code should work right out of the box unless I didn't read something important in the
tutorials. I'll try to test it myself over the next few days but again if you can spare time I'd appreciate help in testing or at least
looking through the code and getting an idea of what's going on.

You can find information on the source code here http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile-hub/latest/developerguide/getting-started-source-code-android.html
If you have questions I'll try to answer as best I can; AWS has a lot of info to take in. You can try to browse their website and read
about it on your own. You should probably start here https://aws.amazon.com/mobile/?hp=tile&so-exp=below

I'd like to add that AWS is free only up to certain data limits and if those limits are exceeded I will be charged so please don't try
to overload this shit. I think the free services should cover what we need and plenty more beyond that though.

The main purpose of this is to just give us an idea of how to start and to see if AWS can be reliably used to set up our backend.
